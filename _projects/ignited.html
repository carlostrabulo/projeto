            <p><em>IGNITED</em> is a proposed biannual publication that explores different facets of technology and
                their impact on shaping our society, culture and the individual. As technology continues to infiltrate
                and impregnate every aspect of our lives, steadily evolving and turning sci-fi dreams and fantasies
                (sometimes dystopian) into reality, its consequences have, many times, become an afterthought to the
                convenience it brings.</p>
            <p">Having already a substantial grasp on the human life, culture, and societies, some of technologies’
                downsides and problems are recently coming to light, but as we delve into an abyss, of ever-evolving,
                increasingly unintelligible creations and mechanisms, it becomes equally arduous understanding and
                perceiving its repercussions, so we are able to take a hard look at what we are immersing ourselves
                into.</p>
                <p>It should not be underplayed the paramount importance and beneficial significance of the advances of technology, as such, IGNITED strives not to criticize technology but actually become a guide to an increasingly confusing world, exploring and trying actively to comprehend the effects of these advances on all scopes.</p>
                <p><em>IGNITED</em>-set on fire-the technological revolution has already begun, and there is no way of stopping it, change is and will be inevitable, but as we walk this path we should do it consciously and carefully as positive effects may be remarkable and extraordinary, but adverse ramifications are sure to follow.</p>
